"""
Getting the time complexity of an iterative solution

1. Compute the Big-O for each line in isolation.
2. If something is in a loop, multiply it's Big-O by the loop for the total.
3. If two things happen sequentially, add the Big-Os.
4. Drop leading multiplicative constants from each Big-O.
5. From all the Big-Os that are added, drop all but the biggest, dominating one.

# Polynomial Time
"""
Key Points
- This gets bad quickly, but a computer can normally handle an n of a few hundred
- It's easy to confuse this with exponential time. The difference is that here, the number grows, but the exponent stays the same. It's opposite for exponential, where the number stays the same, but the exponent grows.
- The keywords for polynomial are pairs, triplets, etc. Sometimes you have to think to get this - finding a match on two names of lists is a pair
- One point of algorithms and data structures is to improve solutions that have this runtime or worse
